# What's this?
This is a simple refactoring exercise that is meant to teach something about dependency inversion and dependency injection.

The documentation is in [this blog bost](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154).

## How to start

Run all the tests. One test will fail. Change production code so that all tests pass.

## How to continue
Read the [blog post](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154) and/or the [presentation included in the Java version](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata).

## Acknowledgements
