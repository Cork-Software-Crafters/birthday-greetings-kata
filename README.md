# Birthday Greetings Kata

## Purpose
To learn about the hexagonal architecture, which is a good way to structure an application, and how to shield your domain model from external apis and systems.

## Prerequisites
This is not a basic exercise. I suppose you are already familiar with TDD and refactoring.

## Ingredients
This kata can be done in two ways; if you want to try the refactoring way, then import the code in your IDE. If you want to try the TDD way, start with a blank project.

## Acknowledgements
This is an fork of the original kata created by Matteo Vaccari https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata.
Please read his blog post http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154 to find a detailed description of the kata as well as an introduction to the hexagonal architecture.
